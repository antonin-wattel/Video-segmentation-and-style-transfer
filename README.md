4. Download [Pre-trained VGG16 network weights](https://github.com/jcjohnson/pytorch-vgg) - and place it in fast-neural-style-pyton/models.
5. Download [MS-COCO Train Images (2014)](https://cocodataset.org/#download)  (13GB)  - and place unzipped train2014 directory in fast-neural-style-pyton/data/train2014
  Keeping only 2000 images of this data is enough

The notebook should be ready to run !
